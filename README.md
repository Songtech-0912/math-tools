# Math tools (legacy)

> **IMPORTANT:** This repository has been migrated to a [new Codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/Songtech-0912/math-tools). **This old repository is unmaintained**.

These tools are made to help anyone studying math (particularly calculus). At the moment, they include:

- An automatic integral generator (see [notebook](integral-generator.ipynb))
